First, relevant to goal (a), it builds on the qualitative observations of \textcite{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019} and extends the quantitative horizontal description of flow misalignment in \textcite{chadwick_late_2015} by accounting for vertical deformation immediately as a central component of the map-derived data collection.\footnote{Vertical deformation is accounted for in the geophysical modeling stage of \textcite{chadwick_late_2015}.} In other words, constraints on 3D deformation may be computed directly from the \ac{DEM} and mapped lava flows \& channels, prior to running numerical models. This strategy gives first-order insights by mapping regions where especially high magnitudes of 3D deformation are required to explain observed surface features. 

However, the 3D deformation parameter cannot simply be calculated for each point because insufficient attitude information is available for the paleosurface upon which lava flows and channels were originally emplaced. Recall that 3D deformation is the angular distance between the two normal vectors defining each of the initial and final surfaces. Each normal vector (equivalently, each surface attitude) requires two variables: dip and dip direction. Both of these are available for the modern (final) surface \ac{DEM}; however, only dip direction of the paleosurface can be inferred directly from the direction of lava flows. Rather than attempting to estimate paleoslope (dip) from lava flow morphology, this parameter is \textit{constrained.} Specifically, the paleo-dip assigned to each point answers the question: \textit{given modern dip, modern dip direction, and paleo-dip direction, what paleo-dip minimizes 3D deformation?} Through the simplifying assumption of minimum 3D deformation, two variable constraints (paleo-dip \& 3D deformation) can be obtained for the price of one, so to speak.

Second, relevant to goal (b), the previous discussion has shown how an assumption regarding of 3D deformation yields an estimate of paleo-dip which is independent of lava flow morphology (and can thus be compared with estimates derived from such methods). This is important because the numerical models used to test magma reservoir inflation events require construction of a paleo-edifice which no longer exists, and whose geometry must thus be inferred. Therefore, estimates of paleo-dip in addition to measurements of paleo-dip direction will guide first attempts at constructing this paleo-edifice.

To summarize, the 3D deformation strategy is to \begin{inparaenum}[a.]
    \item identify suitable point locations across the summit,
    \item collect attitude information for the modern surface at each point,
    \item infer paleoattitude information based on lava flows or channels at each point, and
    \item constrain total 3D deformation based on initial and final surface attitudes at each point. In this final step, an estimate of paleo-dip is produced as a additional useful result.
\end{inparaenum}
The following sections describe the details of each of these steps.
