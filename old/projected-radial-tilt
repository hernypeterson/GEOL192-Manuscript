\subsection{Minimum 3D Tilt from Discordant Flows}\label{sec:3d-deform}
Figure~\ref{fig:deform-calculated} illustrates conceptually my strategy for calculating \acs{sl1} such that the \acf{deform} between \acs{normal2} and \acs{normal1} is minimized. The associated computational method is derived below.

    \caption{Calculation of \acf{sl1} and \acf{deform}.}\label{fig:deform}
\end{figure}
Beginning with the spherical law of cosines:\footnote{Derived in Appendix~\ref{app:spherical-cosines}}
\begin{equation}
    \acs{deform}
    =\arccos(\sin\acs{sl1}\sin\acs{sl2}\cos\acs{discord}
    +\cos\acs{sl1}\cos\acs{sl2}).
    \label{eq:central-angle}
\end{equation}
For constant (already measured) \acs{discord} and \acs{sl2}, the value of \acs{sl1} which minimizes \acs{deform} can be calculated by setting:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial \acs{sl1}}
    \arccos\left(\sin\acs{sl1}\sin\acs{sl2}\cos\acs{discord}
    +\cos\acs{sl1}\cos\acs{sl2}\right)
    =0.\label{eq:mimimum}
\end{equation}
Differentiating using the chain rule,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{-\,(\cos\ac{sl1}\sin\acs{sl2}
    \cos\acs{discord}-\sin\ac{sl1}\cos\acs{sl2})}
    {\sqrt{1-{(\sin\acs{sl1}\sin\acs{sl2}\cos\acs{discord}
    +\cos\acs{sl1}\cos\acs{sl2})}^2}}
    =0.\label{eq:derivative}
\end{equation}
Multiplying through by the denominator\footnote{The denominator in Equation~\eqref{eq:derivative} is zero when \acs{deform} is \ang{0} or \ang{180}, that is, when \acs{normal2} and \acs{normal1} are equal or antipodal. The $\acs{normal2}=\acs{normal1}$ case behaves as desired in Equation~\eqref{eq:robust-ze'} because $\acs{normal2}=\acs{normal1}\implies\cos\acs{discord}=1\implies\acs{sl1}=\arctan(\tan\acs{sl2}\cdot1)=\acs{sl2}$. The antipodal case is unphysical.} and rearranging to solve for \acs{sl1}:
\begin{gather}
    \cos\ac{sl1}\sin\acs{sl2}
    \cos\acs{discord}-\sin\ac{sl1}\cos\acs{sl2}
    =0,\nonumber\\
    \frac{\sin\acs{sl2}
    \cos\acs{discord}}
    {\cos\acs{sl2}}
    =\frac{\sin\ac{sl1}}{\cos\ac{sl1}},\nonumber\\
    \ac{sl1}
    =\arctan(\tan\ac{sl2}
    \cos\acs{discord}).
    \label{eq:ze'}
\end{gather}
The calculated value of \acs{sl1} can then be substituted back into Equation~\eqref{eq:central-angle} to find \acs{deform}. However, one adjustment must be made to this formula to account for edge cases. Notice in Equation~\eqref{eq:ze'} that when $\cos\acs{discord}$ is negative, so is \acs{sl1}. Since \acs{sl1} ultimately describes a slope, a negative value does not make sense. In fact, this situation corresponds to an \emph{uphill} slope being a closer match with the observed topography than a downhill one, which occurs when the angular distance between the two azimuth values exceeds \ang{90}. This treatment of this case is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reversal}: negative \acs{sl1} values are reset to zero. Thus, the final equation for \acs{sl1} is:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\ac{sl1}
    =\max[0,\arctan(\tan\ac{sl2}
    \cos\acs{discord})].}
    \label{eq:robust-ze'}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Axisymmetric Tilt from Discordant Flows}

Figure~\ref{fig:radial} shows what it means to calculate the component of 3D deformation along the radial-axial plane. Comparison with Figure~\ref{fig:deform-calculated} reveals the geometric similarity between the two problems. Therefore, the same Equation~\ref{eq:ze'} derived in Section~\ref{sec:3d-deform} applies up to small modifications owing to a few important differences. First, there are two distinct blue central angles to be minimized, and thus two distinct red zenith angles to be calculated. The \acf{radial-deform} value to be calculated is the signed difference between the two zenith values, which correspond to the ``projections'' of \acs{normal2} and \acs{normal1} onto the plane containing the $z-$ and $r-$axes. Also, the correction used in Equation~\eqref{eq:robust-ze'} is not desired here, since the vectors \acs{normal2} and \acs{normal1} could just as easily project on either side of the $z-$axis.
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\acs{radial-deform}
    =\arctan(\tan\ac{sl2}
    \cos[\acs{bearing}-\acs{az2}])
    -\arctan(\tan\ac{sl1}
    \cos[\acs{bearing}-\acs{az1}]).}\label{eq:tilt-from-mapping}
\end{equation}
Note that the order of terms (and thus the sign of the difference) is significant. For example, \ang{-5} of radial deformation would represent a ``caving-in'' toward the caldera, while \ang{+5} of radial deformation would be more like an outward bulge.

    {\caption[Reversal case: $\acs{discord}>\ang{90}$]{When $\acs{discord}>\ang{90}$, Equation~\eqref{eq:ze'} gives $\acs{sl1}<0$, which does not make physical sense as a downhill slope in the \acs{az1} direction. Instead, \acs{sl1} is set to zero, the \emph{non-negative} downhill paleo-slope that minimizes \acs{deform}.}\label{fig:reversal}}

It defines the radial-axial plane onto which \acs{normal1} and \acs{normal2} are projected using \acs{deform}-minimizing procedure developed in Section~\ref{sec:3d-deform}. The resulting projected angles \acs{proj1} and \acs{proj2} are not labeled to reduce visual clutter. Their difference $\acs{proj2}-\acs{proj1}=\acs{radial-deform}$ is the component of tilt in the direction radial to the proto-edifice center \acs{center}.}\label{fig:radial}}
