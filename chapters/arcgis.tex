\section{Assigning Paleoslope to Linear Segments}

I use the ``Calculate Geometry Attributes'' with ``Input features'' set to the relevant linear features (Channels or Flowpaths). In the ``Geometry Attributes'' menu, I select the field to be named PALEO\_AZIMUTH. Property: Linea BEaring

Sampling Points:

Use tool ``Generate Points Along Lines''

Input Features: Channels
Output Feature Class: Channels\_SampledPoints
Point Placement: by distance
Distance: \qty{3}{\km}
Do not include endpoints (to avoid over sampling small flows)

Radial-Axial projection
Use tool ``Near'' with input features: points and near features: center ($c$).
