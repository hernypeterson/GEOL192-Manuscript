\section{Evaluation of 3D Deformation}
Key Finding: Estimates of minimum 3D deformation yield different regions of particular interest compared to the inquiry based on horizontal deflection alone. Largely speaking, horizontal deflection exaggerates regions of low overall dip as expected. Regions with high 3D deformation are more localized based on flow polygon inquiry, but more distributed far from the caldera complex according to flow channels. Is this because the channels record an older generation with more accumulated deformation?
