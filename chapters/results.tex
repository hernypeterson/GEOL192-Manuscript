\section{Mapping Coverage: Flows and Channels}
Differentiated lava lows and channels do not uniformly cover the summit of \acf{OM}. Immediately beyond the caldera rim, distinguishable flows are limited mostly to the south-east (e.g., Figure~\ref{fig:uphill-flows}) and north-west margins. Notably, there are essentially zero flows immediately south of the caldera, closer to the modern summit. [FIGURE of all mapped lobate lava flows]. 

Lava channels are more widespread than lobate flows, especially further from the caldera rim
