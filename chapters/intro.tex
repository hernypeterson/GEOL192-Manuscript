\chapter{Introduction}
\ac{OM} is the largest volcano in the solar system (or anywhere else known to science), with a diameter of roughly \qty{600}{\km} (Figure~\ref{fig:edifice}) and a summit elevation of over \qty{20}{\km}~\parencite{plescia_morphometric_2004}. The striking observation which catalyzed the current inquiry is that numerous lava flows around its summit caldera appear to flow uphill~\parencite[Figure~\ref{fig:uphill-flows}; after][]{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019}. Similar discordance between lava flow direction and topography are observed in the flexural basin surrounding the main edifice, with horizontal discordance between flow direction and regional dip direction of up to \ang{\sim15}~\parencite{chadwick_late_2015}, rather than the \ang{\sim180} discordance observed at the summit. In both cases, however, these discrepancies suggest a history of surface deformation that occurred \textit{after} the lava flows were emplaced in what was once a downhill direction. The aim of the current project is to quantify this surface deformation and assess the underlying processes responsible.

\section{Challenges \& Assumptions}
The topographic and structural deformation implies a combination of underlying volcanic processes including a) caldera collapse (i.e., magmatic discharge) and b) subsequent reservoir inflation (i.e., magmatic recharge). Untangling the superposition of these competing factors is challenging in itself, although preliminary inspection of the study region (Figure~\ref{fig:summit}) indicates that these effects may be localized to a) the immediate circumferential region and b) the southern flank, respectively. Additionally, \textit{independent}\footnote{That is, in addition to observed deformation.} stratigraphic constraints on lava flow emplacement relative to the timeline of deformation are unavailable---while crater-dating can be done on lava flows and caldera floors, the timing of reservoir inflation does not leave a temporal record observable from spacecraft. Therefore, certain simplifying assumptions are necessary to make progress with this inquiry. In particular, with only ``initial'' (at flow emplacement) and ``final'' (modern) data points available for each location, only net change can be inferred. For this reason and others to be outlined in Chapter~\ref{cha:methods}, deformation \textit{constraints} will be favored over direct \textit{estimates}.

\section{Research Questions}

The following questions will inform the research project: \begin{enumerate}
    \item can a consideration of 3D geometry in the mapping stage yield additional insight into surface deformation beyond that available from horizontal ``deflection'' of lava flows and channels?
    \item what patterns of regional surface deformation are implied by lava flow and channel misalignment across the summit of \ac{OM}?
    \item what combination of volcanic processes, including caldera collapse and/or reservoir inflation, best account for the reconstructed history deformation?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hypotheses}

My hypotheses follow, with a trend toward increasing speculation for the later-stage research questions:\begin{enumerate}
    \item early consideration of 3D geometry will prevent bias toward flat surfaces (for which horizontal deflection can be achieved with minimal 3D deformation), which will yield different regions of interest than would a purely horizontal deflection-based approach;
    \item based on preliminary inspection of the study area topography, (Figure~\ref{fig:summit}) lava flow and channel deflection will reveal concentrated deformation at the southern flank, with minimal change elsewhere;
    \item significant pressurization of a relatively shallow, broad reservoir (of diameter $\gtrsim$ caldera complex) will prove most consistent with reconstructed history of surface deformation. Effects from caldera collapse will be highly localized, if observable at all.\footnote{In fact, the lava flow alignment method may not be the most effective approach for characterizing this deformation at all due to limited spatial coverage.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background \& Literature Review}

The volcanic history of Mars differs from that of Earth in many ways. On Earth, dominant volcanic systems include mid-ocean ridges, island \& continental arcs, hotspot chains, and \acp{LIP}. Ridges and arcs have no clear analogues on Mars; hotspots and \acp{LIP} share many similarities with martian features but reflect differing thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties.

The martian geologic timescale is different from the terrestrial one; one of the most obvious differences is that the martian scale has finer gradations \textit{early} in its history, (within the first \qty{\sim1.5}{Gyr}) reflecting initial bombardment and dynamic volcanic, geophysical, \& sedimentary processes, while later eons have been more stable and quiescent.

The most precise absolute dating methods using radioisotopes are largely unavailable because few martian samples exist on Earth. Nonetheless, radiochronometry of martian meteorites has revealed volcanic eruptions within the last \qty{\sim1.5}{Gyr}~\parencite[e.g.,][]{cohen_taking_2017}. For assigning dates to specific surfaces, researchers count accumulated craters, which can often constrain absolute ages to within a factor of \num{\sim2}~\parencite{kneissl_map-projection-independent_2011}.

From absolute dating and stratigraphic relationships, three major periods are identified~\parencite{carr_geologic_2010}. First, the Noachian period lasted roughly from \qtyrange{4.1}{3.7}{Ga}. During this period, volcanic activity was common everywhere on Mars. The Tharsis Plateau and \ac{OM} edifices may have been largely constructed by the end of the Noachian~\parencite{isherwood_volcanic_2013}. Next, the Hesperian period \qtyrange{3.7}{3.1}{Ga} saw the end of \ac{LHB}, intermittent flooding but overall reduced prevalence of liquid water, and initial concentration of volcanism within Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces.\footnote{\ac{OM} is distinct from but closely associated with the Tharsis province~\parencite{bleacher_trends_2007}.} Finally, the ongoing Amazonian period (\qty{\sim3.1}{Ga}--present) has been characterized by intermittent localized volcanism within the major provinces, limited fluvial activity, and slow sedimentary processes.

\section{Planetary Volcanism Perspective}
The study of \ac{OM} contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of volcanic processes than could be achieved with a solely Earth-based inquiry. Compared to Earth, the unique challenges of studying martian volcanoes are obvious: the inability to make in-situ measurements and the lack of evidence for ongoing eruptive activity stand out. 

However, there are important advantages as well. Most notably, surface deformation signatures are well preserved in the martian environment over hundreds of millions of years, especially at high elevations where weathering and erosion are far less active. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of deformation history than is commonly available on Earth, where large caldera-forming edifices are rare and often poorly preserved. Additionally, the unique martian conditions that yield the largest volcanoes in the solar system broaden our perspective of how volcanism works in general.
